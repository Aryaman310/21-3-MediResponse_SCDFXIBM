We are 21/3, a team of five students looking to assist the emergency response services of Singapore through innovation in technology and data analysis. The five of us have just graduated from school and our excited to be a part of this competition.

**Quick description**
====================

### Problem statement interpretation
In this project, we shall be tackling the first problem statement, ‘Emergency medical services’.  Within this we shall be working on providing the elderly and vulnerable populations with a method to tackle medical emergency situations with effective usage of Community First Responders (CFRs) and readily available resources.


### Our goal
Our goal is to build an app that integrates hospitals, CFRs and the patient in order to carry out effective medical services in times of need. The few minutes before a patient is transported to a hospital in case of an emergency are critical and we plan on making effective usage of this time period through CFRs to help avoid fatalities. 
Through this app we also look to provide preventive measures and predict such incidents beforehand with the help of constant data collection and analysation. 


### How it works
Upon visiting a hospital, a patient who is diagnosed with a chronic disease (ex. Diabetes, Alzheimer’s) shall receive a sticker with a QR code which is to be applied on the back off their phone. Along with this, they are also required to install the MediResponse app.   When a distress signal is received from this patient by a CFR in range, the responder receives the location of the patient. On arriving, the CFR scans the QR code and immediately receives all the necessary information (ex. Disease of patient, allergies, medications) and instructions on what to do based on the state of the patient before they are able to obtain expert medical attention.This information is called ‘Insta-report’. This can help save many lives as a patient is able to receive effective and personal medical care without the presence of a doctor. The data to be displayed is obtained from the hospital at which the patient is registered beforehand and from the daily inputs of the patient himself.
